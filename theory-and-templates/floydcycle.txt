Floyd’s Cycle Finding (Tortoise and Hare)

Identification: "Detect a cycle," "Find the start of a cycle," or "Find the middle of the list."

Approach: * Detect Cycle: Fast pointer moves 2 steps, slow moves 1. If they meet, there's a cycle.

Find Middle: When fast reaches the end, slow is at the middle.

bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
    ListNode *slow = head, *fast = head;
    while (fast && fast->next) {
        slow = slow->next;
        fast = fast->next->next;
        if (slow == fast) return true;
    }
    return false;
}
