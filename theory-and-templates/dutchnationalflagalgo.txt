Dutch National Flag (DNF) Algorithm
Identification: Problems asking to sort/group elements of 3 distinct types (e.g., 0s, 1s, and 2s) in-place and in O(n).
Pattern: Partitioning an array into three sections using three pointers.

Used for sorting 0s, 1s, and 2s in one pass.

void sortColors(vector<int>& nums) {
    int low = 0, mid = 0, high = nums.size() - 1;
    while (mid <= high) {
        if (nums[mid] == 0) swap(nums[low++], nums[mid++]);
        else if (nums[mid] == 1) mid++;
        else swap(nums[mid], nums[high--]); // high element is unexamined, don't increment mid
    }
}
